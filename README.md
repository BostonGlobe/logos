Logo Library
============

A collection of official logos for the Boston Globe, Boston.com, and other Boston Globe Media projects, in vector and rasterized formats.


## Terms
- **Logo:** The official graphic mark used to represent a project.
- **Bug:** A smaller, compact emblem similar to the logo also used to represent a project.
- **Lockup:** The combination of logo and tagline.


## Naming Convention

File names use the following system: `project` + `type` + `color`. So, a white Boston Globe bug logo asset would be called `bglobe-bug-white.png`.


## Usage

### Internal
- Rasterized logos images are in PNG format, measuring 500px at their largest measure. PNGs have been optimized via [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/).
- Please do not upsize rasterized logos. If you need a logo at a larger size, please create it via rasterizing a SVG version. 
- SVGs artboards measure 500px at their largest measure. SVGs have been optimized via [SVGO GUI](https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui).
- Logos are available using the official brand colors, as well as pure black and white treatments. 
- The `src/` directory in this repo contains the source files used to create these logo assets. Each project is built using [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

### External
- Please do not use/modify logos without the explicit permission of Boston Globe Media. 


## Where are the favicons, Apple touch icons, generic social media icons, etc.?

Those assets are currently kept in a separate project and are waiting for review before they can be added to this repo. [Contact us](https://github.com/BostonGlobe) if you need assistance.
