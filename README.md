Logo Library
=====

A collection of official logos for the Boston Globe, Boston.com, and other relevant projects, in both source vector forms and raster PNG formats.

## Notes
- Black fill logo variants use rich black, assuming the majority of the use will be for web.
- It's a subtle difference, but the black used for the Boston Globe logo is different than rich black (#231F20 vs. #000000), hence the need for two separate files.
